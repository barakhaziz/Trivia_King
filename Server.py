# TOP PRIORITY TASKS FOR ALL OF US!
# 1. check the assignment requirements again! every step, everyone by its own!
# 1. בעברית שיהיה ברור: שכל אחד יעבור על כל דרישות העבודה לוודא שכלום לא פוספס
# 2. In your time, run all cases again to identify more bugs
# 3. verify there is no busy waiting in the code, and no 1% usage of the CPU - Barak


# sub missions:
# 1. fix bot behavior error handling
# 2. test error handling: data corruption and empty message
# 3. add more comments to the code
# 4. add more exception handling both client and server
# 5. add more print statements/delete unnecessary prints
# 6. details about our mechanisms for each case
# 7. create readme file in the repository that explain all our assumptions, mechanism and architecture - Amit (V)
# 8. verify case when client was wrong and disconnect due to network error - Oded
# 9. in case of duplicate name, the client generate new name and connect to the server


# bugs
# clients bugs:
# 1. the client print wired messages: getting 2 broadcast from 2 servers although its the same server(different ips)
# 2. inactive clients prints 2 time the message "round x but you are out of the game" - Amit
# 3. In case client type invalid input for the whole round, the server will do hard remove from the game


# server bugs:


# FIXED bugs:
# 1. FIXED! handle case of game over: only one player answer incorrectly and the other didn't answer - Amit
# 2. FIXED! the client didn't start listening for offers after the server close connection - Amit
# 3. FIXED! in game with bots, there is no winner in case of one correct answer and all the rest are wrong (basically like 2) - Amit
# 4. FIXED in case of duplicate name, the clients wont stop generating the same name and keep try to connect server - Amit
# 5. FIXED! bot not remove clients from game after first round: test 7 bots client file - Amit


# Nice to have\to consider - please work only if all the bugs are fixed:
# 1. handle case where before game start, the client connect and then disconnect due to network error
# 2. how to identify when client disconnect due to network error or didn't answer
# 3. generate new questions and not hard coded questions, oded suggestion


# Scenarios to test:
# All the cases 1-7
# The server disconnect from the clients by shutdown server and then client back to listening for offers
# All the client disconnect from the server by shutdown client and then the server will send broadcast message
# When game is over both client and server will disconnect from each other and the server will send broadcast message and client will back to listening for offers
# Duplicate client name of non bot client in the game
# Duplicate client name of bot client in the game


# Done
# 1 send message to the client that the game is canceled - bug 1 fixed
# 2 fix bot generating T,F if already deleted from the game - bug 2 fixed
# 3. if port 5555 is taken, the server will try to bind to the next available port
# 4. step 8 from the assignment - send broadcast only or ready to play game again? now the server ready start game again and send broadcast
# 5. step 9 from the assignment




# mechanisms:
# 1. server disconnect handling: if no answer from the server, the client has timeout of SERVER_NO_RESPONSE_TIMEOUT
# 2. if only one player is connected, the server will wait WAIT_FOR_2_CLIENTS_AT_LEAST and then cancel the game
# 3. when game ended, the server will send broadcast message to all clients and be ready to start a new game (not just broadcast)
# 4. client disconnect handling: if a player didn't answer in the round, he removed from the game completely - try close it session
